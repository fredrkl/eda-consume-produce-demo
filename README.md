# Event Driven Architecture - Consume, process, and produce event pattern

This repository demonstrates the _Transactional Consumeâ€“Produce_ pattern using
an event-driven architecture. It showcases how to consume events from a source,
process them, and produce new events to a target system in a transactional
manner. The repo uses the [KafkaFlow](https://github.com/Farfetch/kafkaflow)
library to facilitate Kafka integration.
