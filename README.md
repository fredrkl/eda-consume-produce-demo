# Event Driven Architecture - Consume, process, and produce event pattern

This repository demonstrates the Transactional Consumeâ€“Produce pattern using an
event-driven architecture. It showcases how to consume events from a source,
process them, and produce new events to a target system in a transactional
manner. Additionally, it showcases the use of the
[KafkaFlow](https://github.com/Farfetch/kafkaflow) library to facilitate Kafka
integration.
